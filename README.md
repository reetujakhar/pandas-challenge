# pandas-challenge

Analysed students_complete_csv and schools_complete_csv files using pandas and jupyter notebook to compare the students/school performance
in charter and district schools.
Created multiple dataframes to catagorise data and show in the report.


ANALYSIS:

 The overall passing percentage is much higher in charter schools as compared to district schools,
despite the large school size of public schools and small school size of charter schools.


CONCLUSION :

1.) Inspite of having high spending rates per student(high total school Budget), the grades and 
overall performance of students is poor in district schools, as opposed to charter schools.
2.) Bottom performing schools are District inspite of having more students, whereas charter 
schools are the top performing ones even with less students count.
